# Week 4

This week's lab is meant to introduce you to some useful methods and processes for cleaning data. In particular, we will cover the following:

- merging datasets
- the data frame index
- accessor functions
- applying functions
- map, reduce, and filter
- melt and pivot

This week we will also introduce Python modules and files.

## setup

*(As of January 2026)*

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository.
2. Clone this repository using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/quickstart) or using [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).
3. See the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file. Create this environment locally using `conda env create -f environment.yml` and load it, or use an existing environment that already has these packages installed.
4. This week' exercise will require you to create a separate GitHub repository. Your submission for this week will be *that* repository, not this one. See the *exercises.ipynb* notebook for more details.
